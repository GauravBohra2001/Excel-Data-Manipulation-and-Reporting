# Excel-Data-Manipulation-and-Reporting
This repository contains an Excel project showcasing data manipulation tasks, including fetching, sorting, and creating columns based on specific conditions. The project also includes a PDF explanation document with screenshots and a README file for instructions.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to perform various data manipulation tasks on a dataset and create a report dashboard using Google Data Studio. The tasks involve filtering data based on specific criteria, creating new columns with calculated values, categorizing stocks based on market capitalization, and generating meaningful visualizations.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Manipulation

In this task, we perform several data manipulation operations on the dataset:

1. Fetch data from the "Data Set" sheet where the PE Ratio is not blank and PE Ratio < 100. Sort the data in descending order of Market Cap Amount.

2. Create two columns for Industry and NSE/BSE Code using the Vlookup function. Apply the Vlookup formula with "ARRAYFORMULA" to ensure it is applied throughout the column.

3. Create two additional columns, "Bear Mode 1" and "Bear Mode 2," based on specific conditions related to the % Change from 52 Week High and % Change from 52 Week Low.

4. Create a column named "Stock Status" and apply multiple IF conditions to determine if a stock is a "Good Stock" based on criteria such as PE Ratio, Bear Mode 1, and Bear Mode 2.

5. Categorize stocks based on their Market Cap size and create a new column named "Cap Size" with appropriate categories.

### Task 2: Report Dashboarding

In this task, we create a report dashboard using Google Data Studio:

1. Connect the final organized data source sheet to Google Data Studio.

2. Design and create meaningful and attractive reports that provide valuable insights into the dataset.

3. Include appropriate filters, scorecard charts, and various types of graphical and tabular analysis to facilitate data analysis.
